# 3. User Interface Design Goals

## 3.1 Overall UX Vision
The user experience should be **polished, intuitive, and professional**, reflecting a production-ready application. The UI must clearly demonstrate the core value proposition: automated diligence report, checklist generation, and document chat with clear provenance, presented in a clean and trustworthy interface suitable for legal professionals.

## 3.2 Key Interaction Paradigms
* **Document Upload:** A seamless drag-and-drop or file selection mechanism with clear feedback on upload progress and success/failure.
* **Process Initiation:** A clear, prominent action to start analysis, with visual indication that processing is underway.
* **Results Display:** A well-structured and easily navigable view for the Summary Report and Checklist. Provenance links must be obvious and functional. Risk levels should be visually distinct.
* **Chat Interaction:** Standard chat interface elements (input box, send button, message history) for querying documents.
* **Status Indication:** Clear, non-intrusive notifications for processing status, completion, and any errors.

## 3.3 Core Screens and Views
Conceptually, the prototype requires the following main views for the `localhost` demo:
1.  **Document Upload Screen:** Interface for selecting and uploading contract files.
2.  **Analysis Results Screen:** Displays the generated Summary Report, including extracted clauses, risk scores, and provenance information.
3.  **Checklist/Follow-up Screen:** Displays the generated checklist or follow-up questions.
4.  **Chat with Documents Screen:** Interface for asking questions about the processed documents.

## 3.4 Accessibility
* **Compliance Target:** WCAG AA (Must adhere to these standards).

## 3.5 Branding
* **Aesthetic Goal:** The UI should have an **ultra-modern, clean, and sophisticated aesthetic**, drawing inspiration from contemporary AI platforms like **Harvey AI**. This implies minimalist design, clear typography, and subtle animations or transitions. Architect may recommend a specific component library to achieve this efficiently.
* **Theme**: **Light Theme only** for this prototype.

## 3.6 Target Device and Platforms
* **Platform:** Web Responsive (Desktop-first focus, but ensuring usability on tablet/mobile is a plus).
