# Project Brief: Legal OS - M&A Diligence Module (AIE8 Challenge)

**Document Owner:** Mary, Business Analyst ðŸ“Š
**Status:** Finalized
**Next Step:** Handoff to Product Manager (John)

## 1. Executive Summary

* **Product Concept:** An AI-Powered Diligence Agent for M&A lawyers, designed as the first module of a global "Legal OS." It automates contract review, risk-flagging, and summarization.
* **Problem:** M&A due diligence is a slow, manual, and error-prone process for legal teams, representing a critical, non-billable risk.
* **Target Market:** Mid-size law firms, in-house legal teams, and boutique M&A firms.
* **Scope:** The prototype will be a full-stack `localhost` application. It will be built using publicly available U.S. datasets (due to their availability) to satisfy all requirements of the AIE8 Certification Challenge Rubric.

## 2. Problem Statement

* **Current State:** Legal teams spend dozens of hours manually reviewing contracts (NDAs, SPAs, etc.) during M&A due diligence. This includes identifying key clauses, flagging risky or missing terms, comparing them to firm standards, and summarizing red flags for the deal team.
* **Impact:** This process is slow, expensive, and subject to human error, creating significant unmitigated risk in high-stakes transactions.
* **Gap:** No current tool handles the end-to-end diligence workflow with localized logic and courtroom-grade provenance. Current "copilots" assist; this solution will *automate*.

## 3. Proposed Solution

* **Core Concept:** A multi-agent RAG application (the "Transactional Cluster") that ingests deal documents, classifies them, extracts key clauses, detects red flags, scores risk, and generates summary reports and checklists.
* **Key Differentiators:** A modular, six-agent architecture designed for collaboration, line-by-line provenance for all generated summaries, and a design that is architected for future multi-jurisdictional support.

## 4. Target Users

* **Primary Segment:** Mid-size law firms (Need: Faster diligence, fewer junior hours; Persona: Managing Partner, M&A Head).
* **Secondary Segment:** In-house legal teams (Need: Better risk awareness, checklist automation; Persona: General Counsel, Legal Ops).
* **Tertiary Segment:** Boutique M&A firms (Need: Premium service at leaner headcount; Persona: Founder, Deal Lawyer).

## 5. Goals & Success Metrics

* **Primary Goal (Rubric):** Build an end-to-end prototype that satisfies all requirements of the **AIE8 Certification Challenge Rubric**.
* **Key Rubric-Driven Metrics:**
    * Deliver a `localhost` deployable full-stack application.
    * Create a "Golden Test Data Set" to evaluate the pipeline.
    * Assess the RAG pipeline using RAGAS for faithfulness, response relevance, context precision, and context recall.
    * Quantify performance improvements from swapping a base retriever with an advanced one, providing results in a table.
    * Deliver a 5-minute Loom demo and all project code/documentation.
* **Key Product Metrics (for the prototype):**
    * Accuracy of clause extraction: >90% precision/recall.
    * Risk flagging recall: 85â€“90% for high-risk clauses.

## 6. MVP Scope

* **Core Features (Must Have):**
    * Implement the full **Transactional Cluster** as a modular, six-agent system:
        1.  Ingestion Agent
        2.  Clause Extraction Agent
        3.  Risk Scoring Agent
        4.  Summary Agent
        5.  Checklist Agent
        6.  Provenance Agent.
    * Build a full-stack application with a frontend that runs on `localhost`.
    * Develop a Jupyter Notebook testing environment that can import the backend logic.
    * The notebook environment must be able to:
        * Test each of the six agents independently.
        * Test the full *collaboration* of all agents in the workflow.
        * Run RAGAS evaluations.
* **Out of Scope for MVP:**
    * Implementation of any non-U.S. jurisdictional logic (e.g., Canada, Saudi). This will be planned in the architecture but not built.
    * Automated redlining.
    * Deep integration with external Law Firm DMS or billing systems.
    * OCR for non-text-readable documents.

## 7. Post-MVP Vision

* **Phase 2:** Integrate other jurisdictions (Canada, Gulf) as seen in the "Legal OS" vision.
* **Long-term Vision:** Expand to other legal clusters (Litigation, Compliance, Knowledge) to build the full "Legal OS" platform.

## 8. Technical Considerations (for the Architect)

* **Core Tech:** A multi-agent RAG application built with modular, collaborative agents.
* **Deployment:** Must be deployable via `localhost` (Architect to propose Docker Compose solution).
* **Testability:** The backend architecture *must* be structured as an installable library that can be imported into Jupyter Notebooks (via Jupytext `.py` scripts) for testing and evaluation.
* **Evaluation:** The system must support evaluation using the RAGAS framework.

## 9. Constraints & Assumptions

* **Data Source:** The prototype will use a publicly available U.S. contract dataset. The exact dataset is to be recommended by the Architect.

## 10. Risks & Open Questions

* **Risk:** The six-agent collaborative model (using ReAct) may introduce significant complexity for an MVP.
* **Open Question:** What is the optimal data-sharing/state-management mechanism between the collaborating agents (to be decided by Architect)?

## 11. Areas Needing Further Research

* **Data Source:** Research and recommend the optimal publicly available U.S. contract dataset (e.g., SEC EDGAR, or alternatives) to serve as the initial data source for the MVP's RAG pipeline.
* **Agent Framework:** Confirm LangChain (esp. LangGraph) is the best fit for building a *modular and collaborative* six-agent ReAct system testable in notebooks.

## 12. Next Steps

* Handoff this Project Brief and the AIE8 Rubric to **John (Product Manager)**.
* John will use these documents to create the detailed **Product Requirements Document (PRD)**.
