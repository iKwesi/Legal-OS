# NFR Validation Results
nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Environment-based configuration, no hardcoded secrets, proper file type validation. Minor observations documented for post-MVP enhancement (file size limits, session cleanup)."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Appropriate for MVP scale. Batch processing implemented, async file handling, efficient algorithms. Sequential embedding generation noted for future optimization."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Comprehensive error handling, graceful degradation on partial failures, extensive logging for debugging."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Clean code structure, comprehensive docstrings, type hints throughout, modular design with clear separation of concerns."

# Risk Assessment

    high: 0
    medium: 0
    low: 3
  recommendations:
    must_fix: []
    monitor:
      - "File storage accumulation (files saved indefinitely)"
      - "No file size limits at API level"
      - "Session IDs have no expiration mechanism"

# Detailed findings
findings:
  strengths:
    - "Clear separation of concerns across modules (ingestion, chunking, vector_store, pipeline)"
    - "Comprehensive logging throughout all components"
    - "Proper error handling with meaningful error messages"
    - "Type hints used consistently"
    - "Configuration management using pydantic-settings"
    - "Good use of dependency injection patterns"
    - "Docstrings present for all major functions and classes"
    - "Batch processing with partial failure support"
    - "Clean abstraction over Qdrant operations"
    - "Proper HTTP status codes and error responses in API"
  
  test_coverage:
    overall: "GOOD (85% estimated)"
    unit_tests: "Comprehensive coverage of core components"
    integration_tests: "End-to-end workflows verified (using mocks)"
    api_tests: "Proper use of FastAPI TestClient"
    gaps:
      - "No actual integration test with real Qdrant instance"
      - "No tests for very large documents (>10MB)"
      - "No concurrency tests for simultaneous uploads"
      - "Limited testing of partial failure recovery in batch operations"
