recommendations:
  immediate:
    - action: "Execute evaluation notebook to generate RAGAS metrics for all 4 configurations"
      refs: ["notebooks/E02_Evaluation_Part1.py"]
      rationale: "Required to complete ACs 5, 6, 7 with data-driven decisions"
    - action: "Update chunking-strategy-selection.md with actual evaluation results"
      refs: ["docs/decisions/chunking-strategy-selection.md"]
      rationale: "Replace '[TBD after run]' placeholders with real RAGAS scores"
    - action: "Update base-retriever-selection.md with actual evaluation results"
      refs: ["docs/decisions/base-retriever-selection.md"]
      rationale: "Replace '[TBD after run]' placeholders with real RAGAS scores"
  
  future:
    - action: "Consider adding integration tests that run actual evaluations with small dataset"
      refs: ["backend/tests/test_rag.py"]
      rationale: "Would catch issues with evaluation pipeline earlier"
    - action: "Add cache invalidation based on code changes (e.g., file hash)"
      refs: ["backend/app/rag/evaluation.py"]
      rationale: "Current cache invalidation is manual; automated would be more robust"

# Final notes
notes: |
  This is an exceptionally well-implemented story with excellent code quality,
  comprehensive testing, and thoughtful architecture. The only gap is the execution
  of the evaluation notebook to generate actual RAGAS metrics, which is required
  to complete the data-driven decision making specified in ACs 5, 6, and 7.
  
  The implementation is production-ready and the evaluation framework is solid.
  Once the evaluation is run and decisions are documented with real data, this
  story will be complete and ready for Done status.
  
  Estimated time to completion: 1-2 hours (mostly waiting for LLM responses during evaluation).
