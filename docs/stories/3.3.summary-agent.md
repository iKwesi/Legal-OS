## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context

**Agent Location:** `backend/app/agents/summary.py`
[Source: architecture/6-implementation-details.md#62]

**Agent Pattern:** ReAct using LangChain
[Source: architecture/6-implementation-details.md#64]

**Retriever:** Vector Similarity (from Story 2.1)
[Source: docs/decisions/base-retriever-selection.md]

**Input:** RiskScoringResult from Story 3.2 + Vector Store
**Output:** DiligenceMemo (Markdown/JSON)

### Summary Structure

**Diligence Memo Sections:**

1. **Executive Summary**
   - Document overview
   - Overall risk assessment
   - Critical findings (top 3-5)
   - Primary recommendations

2. **Clause-by-Clause Analysis**
   - Payment Terms summary + risk level
   - Warranties summary + risk level
   - Indemnification summary + risk level
   - Termination summary + risk level
   - Confidentiality summary + risk level
   - Non-Compete summary + risk level
   - Dispute Resolution summary + risk level

3. **Key Findings**
   - High/Critical risk items
   - Missing standard protections
   - Unusual or non-standard terms
   - Favorable terms

4. **Recommendations**
   - Immediate actions required
   - Negotiation priorities
   - Additional due diligence needed
   - Risk mitigation strategies

5. **Overall Assessment**
   - Deal viability assessment
   - Risk/reward balance
   - Final recommendation (Proceed/Proceed with Caution/Do Not Proceed)

### LLM Configuration

**Model:** OpenAI GPT-4o-mini
**Tracing:** LangSmith enabled
**Framework:** LangGraph with StateGraph
[Source: architecture/3-tech-stack.md]

### Required Tools

The agent needs three main capabilities:
1. **Context Retrieval** - Retrieve additional document context using Vector Similarity retriever
2. **Summary Generation** - Generate concise summaries for each clause type
3. **Recommendations Generation** - Create actionable recommendations based on risk analysis

### Data Models

**Required Pydantic Models:** (in `backend/app/models/agent.py`)
- `ExecutiveSummary` - High-level summary with key findings
- `ClauseSummary` - Summary for each clause type
- `KeyFinding` - Individual finding with severity
- `Recommendation` - Actionable recommendation with priority
- `DiligenceMemo` - Complete memo with all sections

### Markdown Output Structure

The agent must generate a structured Markdown document with these sections:
1. Executive Summary (overview, critical findings, primary recommendations)
2. Clause-by-Clause Analysis (for each M&A clause type)
3. Key Findings (high/critical risk items)
4. Recommendations (prioritized by urgency)
5. Overall Assessment (final recommendation: Proceed/Caution/Do Not Proceed)

### Integration Points

**Input:** RiskScoringResult from Story 3.2 + Vector Store for context
**Output:** DiligenceMemo with Markdown and JSON formats
**Retriever:** Vector Similarity from Story 2.1

## Testing

**Test Location:** `backend/tests/test_summary.py`

**Test Coverage Requirements:**
- Agent initialization and configuration
- Summary generation quality
- Executive summary completeness
- Recommendations relevance
- Markdown formatting correctness
- Complete end-to-end agent execution
- Error handling and edge cases

**Testing Framework:** Pytest (per architecture/3-tech-stack.md)
