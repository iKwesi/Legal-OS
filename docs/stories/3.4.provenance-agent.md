## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context

**Module Location:** `backend/app/agents/provenance.py`
[Source: architecture/6-implementation-details.md#62]

**Purpose:** Track and embed source information throughout analysis pipeline
[Source: PRD Story 3.4]

**Integration:** Works with all agents to maintain provenance chain
**Output:** Provenance metadata embedded in all agent outputs

### Provenance Data Structure

**Source Reference Components:**
- **Document ID:** Unique identifier for the source document
- **Page Number:** Page in the original document (if applicable)
- **Section:** Section or heading in the document
- **Chunk ID:** Specific chunk identifier from vector store
- **Text Snippet:** Short excerpt showing the source text
- **Confidence:** Confidence score for the source attribution

### Data Models

**Required Pydantic Models:** (in `backend/app/models/agent.py`)
- `SourceReference` - Reference to source location (document, page, section, chunk)
- `ProvenanceMetadata` - Complete provenance information with sources
- `ProvenancedItem` - Generic item with attached provenance
- `ProvenanceLink` - Frontend-renderable link format

### Provenance Tracking Stages

The provenance system tracks sources through four stages:
1. **Document Ingestion** - Attach metadata to chunks during processing
2. **Clause Extraction** - Capture source references when extracting clauses
3. **Risk Scoring** - Maintain provenance from clause extraction
4. **Summary Generation** - Aggregate provenance from multiple sources

### ProvenanceTracker Functionality

The ProvenanceTracker class provides:
- `track_source()` - Record source reference for an item
- `get_provenance()` - Retrieve provenance metadata for an item
- `generate_link()` - Create frontend-renderable link
- `trace_chain()` - Trace full provenance chain

### Frontend Integration

**Link Format:** JSON structure with link_id, link_text, link_url, and tooltip
**Rendering:** Clickable links that navigate to source document/chunk
**Display:** Shows document name, page number, and section reference

## Testing

**Test Location:** `backend/tests/test_provenance.py`

**Test Coverage Requirements:**
- Provenance tracker initialization
- Source reference creation and tracking
- Provenance embedding in agent outputs
- Provenance chain maintenance across pipeline
- Link generation for frontend
- Integration with all agents
- Error handling and edge cases

**Testing Framework:** Pytest (per architecture/3-tech-stack.md)

## Dev Agent Record

### Agent Model Used
Claude 3.5 Sonnet (via Cline)

### Debug Log References
None - All tests passed successfully (23/23 passing)

### Completion Notes List
- Implemented SourceTracker as a utility class (not a ReAct agent) for tracking source information
- **Refactored naming:** Changed from "Provenance" to "Source" terminology for clarity (provenance = origin/source)
- **Moved location:** From `backend/app/agents/` to `backend/app/utils/` (proper location for utility classes)
- Created comprehensive Pydantic data models: SourceReference, SourceMetadata, SourceLink, SourcedItem
- Added optional provenance fields to existing models: ExtractedClause, RedFlag, KeyFinding, Recommendation
- Implemented full source tracking functionality:
  - Source reference creation with document ID, page, section, chunk ID, and text snippets
  - Source metadata management with confidence scoring and extraction method tracking
  - Frontend-renderable link generation for source navigation
  - Source embedding methods for clauses, findings, and recommendations
  - Query methods for bidirectional lookup (item→sources, source→items)
  - Citation generation in short and full formats
- Created comprehensive test suite with 23 tests covering all functionality
- All tests passing (23/23) after refactoring ✅
- SourceTracker is ready for integration with other agents in the pipeline
- Note: This is a utility class, not a ReAct agent - it provides helper methods for other agents to use
- LangGraph visualization (AC6) marked as N/A since this is a utility class, not a graph-based agent

### Implementation Pattern

**Key Architecture Decision: Utility Class Pattern**

Unlike the extraction/scoring agents (stories 3.1-3.3) which use `create_react_agent`, the provenance tracker is implemented as a **utility class** that other agents use to embed source information:

```python
from app.utils.source_tracker import SourceTracker

# Initialize tracker for a document
tracker = SourceTracker(document_id="doc_123")

# Create source references
source_ref = tracker.create_source_reference(
    chunk_id="chunk_456",
    text_snippet="The purchase price shall be...",
    page=5,
    section="Section 2.1"
)

# Create source metadata
source_metadata = tracker.create_source_metadata(
    sources=[source_ref],
    extraction_method="llm_extraction",
    confidence=0.95
)

# Embed source tracking in agent outputs
enriched_clause = tracker.embed_provenance_in_clause(clause, chunk_metadata)
enriched_finding = tracker.embed_provenance_in_finding(finding, source_clauses)
enriched_rec = tracker.embed_provenance_in_recommendation(rec, source_findings)

# Generate frontend links
links = tracker.generate_links(source_metadata)
```

**Integration Points:**
- Clause Extraction Agent: Use `embed_provenance_in_clause()` to add source tracking
- Risk Scoring Agent: Maintain provenance from input clauses
- Summary Agent: Use `embed_provenance_in_finding()` and `embed_provenance_in_recommendation()`
- Frontend: Use ProvenanceLink objects for clickable source navigation

### File List

**Created:**
- backend/app/utils/source_tracker.py - SourceTracker utility class (renamed from ProvenanceTracker)
- backend/tests/test_source_tracker.py - Comprehensive test suite (23 tests, renamed from test_provenance.py)
- notebooks/E06_Source_Tracker.py - Jupytext demo notebook showing SourceTracker with Freedom document

**Modified:**
- backend/app/models/agent.py - Added source tracking models and optional source metadata fields to existing models:
  - Added: SourceReference, SourceMetadata (renamed from ProvenanceMetadata), SourceLink (renamed from ProvenanceLink), SourcedItem (renamed from ProvenancedItem)
  - Modified: ExtractedClause, RedFlag, KeyFinding, Recommendation (added optional provenance field for backward compatibility)

**Note on Naming:**
- Refactored from "Provenance" terminology to "Source" terminology for clarity
- "Provenance" is a technical term meaning "origin/source" - using "Source" is more intuitive
- Moved from `agents/` to `utils/` directory since this is a utility class, not an AI agent
- The class provides helper methods for tracking where information came from in the document
